Installation:
- Double-click the Application file attached and follow the instructions.
- Run the installed application named "LoadDistributionSimulation" (you can use the shortcut created on the Desktop, for example). 

Running the simulation:
- Hold down the right mouse button to temporarily disable camera controls and conveniently adjust the parameters of the simulation.
- Having configured the parameters and chosen the algorithm, hit "Start!" button and observe the simulation.
- Use arrows or WASD to move the camera around.
- Once the simulation is over, you will receive the statistical data generated by the examined algorithm in the folder "LoadDistributionSimulationOutput" located on the Desktop.
- Repeat.

Have fun!
